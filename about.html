            Thaikkudam Bridge the rock band with a soundscape built upon elements of folk and classical sounds of India
            interspersed, at times, with layers of progressive, pop, ambient and electronic textures. 10 years, 650+
            shows, 100+ international shows in 25 countries, it truly has been a stupendous journey for the band. With a
            15 member ensemble cast the band's strength lies in its versatility and unpredictability thanks to nine
            vocalists and six instrumentalists from the length and breadth of the country, each of whom brings on board,
            a wealth of diverse musical, linguistic and cultural influences thus creating a unique musical experience
            that is truly global in nature yet local in idea.
